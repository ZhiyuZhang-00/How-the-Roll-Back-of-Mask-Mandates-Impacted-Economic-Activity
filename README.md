# How-the-Roll-Back-of-Mask-Mandates-Impacted-Economic-Activity

On May 13 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that fully vaccinated people can safely stop wearing masks in most settings. After that, many retailers and businesses are revising their own mask mandates. Among them, Walmart reversed their mask requirements on May 18. Based on the panel data on foot traffic in Walmart stores 14 days before and after this policy change, as well as 2020 Voting data and vaccine hesitancy data by county in the United States, multiple linear regression analysis is performed in this study. The data show specifically that daily visits to Walmart rose significantly after the policy change and this effect was influenced by Republican support and vaccine hesitancy within state. This effect was attenuated in counties that are more Republican and significantly enhanced in counties with high vaccine hesitancy.
